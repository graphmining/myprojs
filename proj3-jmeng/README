Project 3: Buffer Replacement in PostgreSQL
CIS6930 Fall 2016
 


A simple approach to implement the LRU policy is to use a doubly-linked list to link up the buffer pages
such that the head page is the least recently used and the tail of the list the most recently used page.

Hence the strategy is that whenever a buffer page is referenced, it is moved to the tail of the list; 
and whenever a replacement page is sought from the list, the unpinned buffer page that is closest to 
the head of the list is selected for eviction.

In my implementation, I maintain a doublely linked LRU list of those buffers with a refcount of 0. 
When a new buffer becomes available, it is unpinned and when its reference count becomes zero, 
it is added to the tail of the free LRU list and the one on the head of the list is alway picked to be replaced.

Data structure design:
typedef struct sbufdesc
{
	BufferTag	tag;			/* ID of page contained in buffer */
	BufFlags	flags;			/* see bit definitions above */
	uint16		usage_count;	/* usage counter for clock sweep code */
	unsigned	refcount;		/* # of backends holding pins on buffer */
	int			wait_backend_pid;		/* backend PID of pin-count waiter */

	slock_t		buf_hdr_lock;	/* protects the above fields */

	int			buf_id;			/* buffer's index number (from 0) */
	int			freeNext;		/* link in freelist chain */

	/*LRU_CHANGE: add lruNext and lruPrev*************/
	int			lruNext;
	int			lruPrev;
 

	LWLockId	io_in_progress_lock;	/* to wait for I/O to complete */
	LWLockId	content_lock;	/* to lock access to buffer contents */
} BufferDesc;


The files I have modified are:
~/src/backend/storage/buffer/buf_init.c
~/src/backend/storage/buffer/bufmgr.c
~/src/backend/storage/buffer/freelist.c
and
~/src/include/storage/buf_internals.h
I have left comments /*LRU_CHANGE*/ at where I made modifications.
