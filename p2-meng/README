Memory Simulator
OCT 2015
Project 2: Measuring the Performance of Page Replacement Algorithms on Real Traces

The memory simulator (memsim.c) is a simulation tool that measures the following
page replacement algorithms:
	-VMS
	-LRU
	-CLOCK
	-OPT

The simulator takes in the following arguments:
	a memory trace file
	a frame number
	a page replacement algorithm
	an option for printing debug or no debug (quite)

USAGE: memsim <tracefile> <nframes> <vms|lru|clk|opt> <debug|quiet> 

Final print will be the total memory frames, events in traces, total disk reads, 
total disk writes.
